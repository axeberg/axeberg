<h3 align="center">
Greetings! I'm <a href="https://codestro.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Axel</a> 👋
</h3>

I'm a software developer by training 💻, currently working as Head of Competence Development 🧠 over at [13|37](https://1337.tech) (we are [hiring!](https://www.1337.careers/)).

I'm currently based in Sweden 🇸🇪 and mostly working from home 🏡. 

My focus and passion is helping people and companies achieve their full potential.

As a firm believer in life-long learning I have have been part of the founding, and running, of a vocational school for software development, during which time I held hundres of live-streamed and recorded lectures, helped guide students to graduation and into new careers as software developers.

During my time as a developer I've worked with everything from telecommunications, to travel agencies, to help grow software organzations and teams.

Feel free to reach out using socials below to learn more about me.
