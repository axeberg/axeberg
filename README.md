# Hi 👋🏼, I'm Axel

I'm a software developer consultant (for [tretton37.com](https://tretton37.com)) based in Sweden. My focus and passion is building things on the web.

My current assignment is at [Doro](https://www.doro.com/en-us/) where I am part of a team building a cloud platform for managing various devices, services and personnel in regards to senior care.

I'm a firm believer in life-long learning and have been part of the founding of a vocational school for software development, during which time I held hundres of live-streamed and recorded lectures, helped guide students to graduation and into new careers as software developers.
